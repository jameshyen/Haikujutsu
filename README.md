## Personal Attempts at Haikus
> Autumn is lovely
> Baking sweet cookies
> Ding! Goes the timer

> Clean sunlight
> Hits my face today
> Roaring wind

## Plan
Haiku must contain:
1. Seasonal reference (drawn from a premade list, i.e. *saijiki*).
  1.[Saijiki Examples] {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saijiki#Examples_of_saijiki_and_kiyose}
2. Two thoughts, separated by a *kireji*. Computer will have to understand different meanings/thoughts, and juxtapose them.
  1. Element of suddenness.
  2. Thought should be related to the *kigo* (seasonal reference).
  3. Probably the most difficult part of the Haiku.
3. Syllable counting, 5-7-5.
  1. Will probably write in English and avoid any Japanese-English translation.
